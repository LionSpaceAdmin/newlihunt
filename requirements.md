# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Scam Hunt is an AI-powered security platform designed to identify and neutralize online impersonation scams targeting supporters of Israel and the IDF. The system provides rapid, context-aware analysis through a conversational interface powered by Google Gemini AI, educates users on evolving scam tactics, and guides them toward verified donation channels. The platform utilizes a hybrid architecture with Vercel handling frontend deployment and AI processing, while AWS provides backend infrastructure for data storage and file handling.
