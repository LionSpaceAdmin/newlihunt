# Vercel Blob Integration - Summary

## Overview

This specification defines the integration of Vercel Blob storage for image uploads in the Scam Hunt Platform, replacing the previous base64 data URL approach.

## Why This Change?

**Previous Approach (Base64):**
- ❌ Large request payloads (~33% size increase)
- ❌ No image persistence or sharing
- ❌ Inefficient caching
- ❌ Limited to smaller images

**New Approach (Vercel Blob):**
- ✅ Efficient file storage with CDN delivery
- ✅ Scalable image handling
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Shareable image URLs
- ✅ Optimized caching

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Base64)
```
User → Select Image → Convert to Base64 → Send to /api/analyze → AI Analysis
```

### After (Vercel Blob)
```
User → Select Image → Upload to /api/upload → Get Blob URL → Send URL to /api/analyze → Fetch Image → AI Analysis
```

## Key Components

### 1. Upload Endpoint (`/api/upload`)
- Accepts multipart/form-data
- Validates file type and size
- Uploads to Vercel Blob
- Returns public Blob URL
- Rate limited: 5 uploads/minute

### 2. Analysis Endpoint (`/api/analyze`)
- Accepts `imageUrl` instead of `imageBase64DataUrl`
- Fetches image from Blob URL
- Converts to base64 for Gemini AI
- Caches using URL-based keys

### 3. Frontend Changes
- `ChatInterface.tsx`: Upload file to `/api/upload`
- `useScamAnalysis.ts`: Send Blob URL to analysis
- Remove base64 conversion logic

### 4. History Service
- Store Blob URLs instead of base64
- Graceful fallback for legacy base64 entries

## Implementation Status

See `tasks.md` for detailed implementation checklist.

## Related Specifications

- **Architecture Consolidation** (`.kiro/specs/architecture-consolidation/`)
  - Requirement 4 superseded by this spec
  - AWS infrastructure removed
  - Vercel KV for rate limiting and caching maintained

## Environment Variables

### Required for Production
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - Automatically set by Vercel

### Optional for Local Development
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - Get from Vercel dashboard

## Migration Notes

### Handling Legacy Data
- Old history entries with base64 images will still display
- New analyses use Blob URLs
- No data migration required

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload JPEG, PNG, WebP images
- [ ] Verify file validation (type, size)
- [ ] Test rate limiting (6 rapid uploads)
- [ ] Analyze uploaded images
- [ ] View history with Blob URLs
- [ ] Test error scenarios

## Documentation Updates

- [x] Created requirements.md
- [x] Created design.md
- [x] Created tasks.md
- [x] Updated architecture-consolidation/requirements.md
- [x] Updated README.md
- [ ] Update GEMINI.md (if needed)

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this specification
2. Begin implementation following tasks.md
3. Test thoroughly in development
4. Deploy to production with BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN configured
