# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing Content Security Policy (CSP) conflicts where external scripts, specifically the Buy Me a Coffee widget (https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/widget.prod.min.js), are being blocked despite being configured in the CSP. The issue stems from having CSP configurations in both next.config.ts and vercel.json that may be conflicting or not properly coordinated.

## Glossary

- **CSP_System**: The Content Security Policy configuration system that controls which resources can be loaded by the web application
- **Widget_Service**: External third-party services like Buy Me a Coffee that provide embeddable widgets
- **Configuration_Manager**: The system responsible for managing and applying security headers across different deployment environments
- **Vercel_Platform**: The deployment platform that processes vercel.json configuration files
- **Next_Framework**: The Next.js framework that processes next.config.ts configuration files

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see the Buy Me a Coffee widget load properly, so that I can support the website creator

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page with the Buy Me a Coffee widget, THE CSP_System SHALL allow the widget script to load from https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com
2. WHEN the widget script loads, THE CSP_System SHALL allow all necessary connections to buymeacoffee.com domains
3. WHEN the widget renders, THE CSP_System SHALL allow inline styles required for proper widget display
4. THE CSP_System SHALL maintain security by only allowing explicitly approved external resources
5. THE CSP_System SHALL prevent any unauthorized script execution while allowing approved widgets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, authoritative CSP configuration, so that there are no conflicts between different configuration sources

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL use only one source for CSP configuration to avoid conflicts
2. WHEN CSP headers are applied, THE Configuration_Manager SHALL ensure consistent policy enforcement across all routes
3. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL validate that CSP directives are properly formatted and complete
4. WHEN deploying to Vercel_Platform, THE Configuration_Manager SHALL ensure compatibility with platform-specific requirements
5. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL provide clear error messages when CSP violations occur

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive CSP coverage for all external resources, so that the application remains secure while supporting necessary third-party integrations

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CSP_System SHALL explicitly define allowed sources for all directive types (script-src, style-src, connect-src, etc.)
2. WHEN new Widget_Service integrations are added, THE CSP_System SHALL provide a clear process for updating allowed sources
3. THE CSP_System SHALL log CSP violations for monitoring and debugging purposes
4. THE CSP_System SHALL use the principle of least privilege, only allowing necessary external resources
5. WHEN CSP policies are updated, THE CSP_System SHALL validate changes before deployment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily test and validate CSP configurations, so that I can ensure widgets work correctly before deployment

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL provide a way to test CSP configurations in development environment
2. WHEN CSP violations occur, THE Configuration_Manager SHALL provide detailed error information in development mode
3. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL allow temporary CSP relaxation for development testing
4. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL validate CSP syntax and completeness during build process
5. WHEN testing widget integrations, THE Configuration_Manager SHALL provide clear feedback on required CSP directives
