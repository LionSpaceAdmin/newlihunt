Scam Hunter Website – Comprehensive To‑Do List for Upgrades and Bug Fixes

Below is a professional, English to‑do list summarizing all issues observed on lionsofzion.io/Scam Hunter during the end‑to‑end inspection.  Each item describes a discrete improvement or bug fix, grouped by area of the site.  Addressing these will improve the user experience, reliability, accessibility and trustworthiness of the product.

General Site Improvements
	•	Add contact and legal pages.  There is no visible way for users to contact the team or view a privacy policy / terms of service.  Create a clear “Contact Us” page with an email form or support address, and add privacy and terms pages in the footer.
	•	Implement a proper footer.  At the bottom of the site there is only a call‑to‑action section.  Add a site footer with navigation links (Home, Analyze, History, Donate), social media icons, legal links and contact information.
	•	Fix non‑functional buttons.  The “Learn More” button in the hero section, the gear icon, and the red lion “Support the Project” icon currently do nothing.  Hook these buttons to their intended destinations (e.g., features section, settings page, donation info).
	•	Improve donation links.  The “Support FIDF” link works, but the “Buy Me Coffee” button initially opens a blank page and takes a long time to load.  Ensure the button opens the external donation page reliably, add a loading indicator, and provide explanatory text about the donation.
	•	Ensure color‑contrast and accessibility.  The dark theme needs better contrast for text and icons, and some images lack descriptive alt tags.  Use accessible color palettes and provide alt text for all decorative and informative images to meet WCAG guidelines.
	•	Add responsive design improvements.  Check the layout on different screen sizes.  Some text overlaps and spacing issues appear on smaller windows; adjust CSS for proper responsiveness.
	•	Include a cookie / data‑use notice if required.  Since the site stores analysis history, add a banner informing users about data storage and obtaining consent.

Product Tour and On‑boarding
	•	Fix the product‑tour navigation.  The multi‑step product tour appears after entering the analysis page but the “Next” button is unresponsive.  Ensure users can move through all steps, with clear progress indicators and a functioning “Skip Tour” button.
	•	Clarify how data is handled.  The first step of the tour mentions that content is analyzed without storing personal information.  Provide a link to the privacy policy or a more detailed explanation to build trust.

Chat/Analysis Interface
	•	Correct quick‑action prompts.  The “Verify Donation Request” and “Inspect Website” buttons insert the wrong prompt (both currently insert the “I want to search the web…” or “Analyze this X profile…” messages).  Each button should prefill a task‑specific prompt: e.g., “I received a donation request from <organization>; is it legitimate?” for the donation check, and “Please analyze this website: <URL> for potential scams.” for the website inspection.
	•	Handle unimplemented tasks gracefully.  For certain prompts (e.g., “Analyze X profile” or “Check suspicious email”) the assistant sometimes never returns a reply.  Implement backend support for all quick‑actions or return a friendly error message stating the feature isn’t ready rather than leaving the user with no response.
	•	Improve the connection status indicator.  The chat header always shows a red “Offline” badge even when responses are delivered.  Update the indicator to reflect actual connectivity or remove it if not needed.
	•	Parse and display analysis results.  When analyzing social media posts, the API returns a JSON‑like response with keys like overall_assessment, summary, details, recommendations and educational_tips.  Instead of showing raw JSON in the chat and history, parse the JSON and present it in a formatted card in the Analysis Results panel.  Include the risk and credibility scores, summary, key findings, recommended actions and education tips.
	•	Populate the Analysis Results panel.  The right‑hand “Analysis Results” section remains blank even after results arrive.  Use this space to show the parsed result card, charts for risk & credibility scores, and any attachments or links extracted from the analysis.
	•	Enable file and image upload.  The input box states that users can “paste a link, or upload an image,” but there is no option to attach files.  Provide an upload button that accepts images, PDFs or screenshots for analysis, and handle them appropriately.
	•	Add support for multiple messages per analysis.  Allow users to send follow‑up questions within the same conversation rather than forcing them to clear the chat each time.  Provide a way to end or archive a conversation.
	•	Implement error handling and loading indicators.  When the backend takes a long time to respond, show a spinner or progress message.  If an error occurs, display an informative message instead of leaving the user with “Scam Hunter is typing…” indefinitely.

History and Reporting
	•	Accurate score display.  Entries in the History page show 0 for both risk and credibility scores, even when an analysis is marked “SAFE.”  Ensure the stored scores reflect actual values returned by the analysis and display them correctly (e.g., 0–100).
	•	Improve history list UI.  Add pagination or lazy loading to handle many analysis records.  Provide filters or search (e.g., by date, risk level or keyword) and sort options.
	•	Enhance the Analysis Report page.  When opening an analysis report, the summary and conversation transcript currently show raw JSON.  Format the summary in plain English, include bullet lists of findings, risk & credibility charts, and highlight any flagged red flags (e.g., suspicious URLs, email addresses).  Display the conversation in a clean chat transcript rather than a code block.
	•	Add report export/sharing options.  Allow users to download a PDF version of the report or copy a shareable link for sending to others.
	•	Confirm before deletion.  The “Delete Analysis” button on the report page should open a confirmation dialog explaining that deletion is irreversible.

Navigation and UX Enhancements
	•	Highlight the active menu item.  In the top navigation bar, visually indicate which page (Home, Analyze, History) the user is on.
	•	Accessible keyboard navigation.  Ensure all interactive elements can be reached via keyboard.  Add focus outlines and ARIA labels where necessary.
	•	Add a settings/profile page.  The gear icon suggests there should be settings, but none exist.  Create a page where users can manage account information, notification preferences and data retention settings.
	•	Improve loading performance.  Optimize images (compress and use modern formats), minify scripts, and enable caching to reduce load times.  The initial page load is heavy and could be improved.
	•	Internationalization/localization.  The site currently uses English; provide Hebrew translations and a language switcher to cater to Israeli users, given the target audience.

Security & Trust
	•	HTTPS enforcement and security headers.  Ensure all pages are served over HTTPS and that appropriate security headers (Content‑Security‑Policy, X‑Frame‑Options, etc.) are set to protect against common web attacks.
	•	Rate limiting and abuse prevention.  Implement safeguards to prevent the analysis endpoint from being overloaded or misused (e.g., by bots sending repeated requests).
	•	Transparency about AI limitations.  Educate users about the limitations of AI‑generated analysis and encourage them to verify findings independently.  This can be included in the FAQ or as a disclaimer near the chat input.

By addressing the issues above, the Scam Hunter website can deliver a much smoother, more reliable and trustworthy experience for users seeking to evaluate online scams and impersonation attempts.
